# Problem Statement
Object Counting, Handwriting Recognition, & Anomaly Detection in Acumen Chip Images

# Description
Each image represents a counting paper with a number of acumen chips on them. Using Computer Vision techniques, teams are expected to produce model(s) which perform the following:

1. Identify the number of chips present on each counting paper.
2. Identify the handwritten manual count present on each counting paper.
3. Indicate the location of anomalies with bounding boxes.
